        <p>Assalam-o-Alaikum.</p>
        <br>

        <br>

        <p>Who is it that would loan Allah a goodly loan so He may multiply it for hum many times over? (Surat Baqara,
            Verse 245)
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>It should be noted that Allah, who is in need of no one and nothing, instills upon his men en to give Qarze
            Hasana because it is in man's nature to be frugal whilst spending hus wealth Allah speaks about qarz because it
            is returned and Allah promases that He will return the g e goodly loan by 70 folds. Allah conveys his message to
            the Muslim ummah through the Holy Prophet Muhammad prompting Muslims to spend their wealth in a certain way He
            says, Oh children of Adam! Trust me with your wealth If you do so, no fire, flood or tlueves will be able to rob
            you off your money Instead, you will be endowed with your weath when you most need it. He further says that the
            poor and weak will not remain hungry and naked except due to the negligence of the tich, who should not be
            stingy in spending their money on those worse off than themselves. Allah will not only take strict
            accountability from those people but He will also punish them accordingly On the Day Of Judgement, the rich will
            be humiliated because they did not help the needy. The needy will complain to Allah and say that all those men.
            on whom you graciously bestowed the rights of wealth showed negligence in its proper use they were busy spending
            on themselves and forgot about us, the ones who needed it. Allah will reply to this and say "I swear on my
            respect and glory! I will bring you closer to me and push them farther away."
          </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Alhamdollilah, Allah has accorded our organization with the highest favor by sending those people our way who
            follow the teachings of the Holy Quran and Hadith, give zakat, fidyah, fitrah, khairat and other donations to
            help us help those in need. The purpose of sending this message to you is so that you not only spread this
            message to others but also play your part in helping us to continue serving and helping the needy till the Day
            of Judgment.
